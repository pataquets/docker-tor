# Advertise this port to listen for connections from Tor clients and servers. This option is required to be a Tor server. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. Set it to 0 to not run an ORPort at all. This option can occur more than once. (Default: 0)
#
# Tor recognizes these flags on each ORPort:
# **NoAdvertise**::
#     By default, we bind to a port and tell our users about it. If
#     NoAdvertise is specified, we don't advertise, but listen anyway.  This
#     can be useful if the port everybody will be connecting to (for
#     example, one that's opened on our firewall) is somewhere else.
# **NoListen**::
#     By default, we bind to a port and tell our users about it. If
#     NoListen is specified, we don't bind, but advertise anyway.  This
#     can be useful if something else  (for example, a firewall's port
#     forwarding configuration) is causing connections to reach us.
# **IPv4Only**::
#     If the address is absent, or resolves to both an IPv4 and an IPv6
#     address, only listen to the IPv4 address.
# **IPv6Only**::
#     If the address is absent, or resolves to both an IPv4 and an IPv6
#     address, only listen to the IPv6 address.
# For obvious reasons, NoAdvertise and NoListen are mutually exclusive, and
# IPv4Only and IPv6Only are mutually exclusive.
