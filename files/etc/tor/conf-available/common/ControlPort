# If set, Tor will accept connections on this port and allow those connections to control the Tor process using the Tor Control Protocol (described in control-spec.txt). Note: unless you also specify one or more of HashedControlPassword or CookieAuthentication, setting this option will cause Tor to allow any process on the local host to control it. (Setting both authentication methods means either method is sufficient to authenticate to Tor.) This option is required for many Tor controllers; most use the value of 9051. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. (Default: 0)
ControlPort 9051 # [flags]

# Bind the controller listener to this address. If you specify a port, bind to this port rather than the one specified in ControlPort. We strongly recommend that you leave this alone unless you know what youâ€™re doing, since giving attackers access to your control listener is really dangerous. This directive can be specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports. (Default: 127.0.0.1) 
ControlListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9051
