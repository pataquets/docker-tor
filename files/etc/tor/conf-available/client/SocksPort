# Open this port to listen for connections from SOCKS-speaking applications. Set this to 0 if you don’t want to allow application connections via SOCKS. Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. This directive can be specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports. (Default: 9050)
# NOTE: Although this option allows you to specify an IP address other than localhost, you should do so only with extreme caution. The SOCKS protocol is unencrypted and (as we use it) unauthenticated, so exposing it in this way could leak your information to anybody watching your network, and allow anybody to use your computer as an open proxy.
# The isolation flags arguments give Tor rules for which streams received on this SOCKSPort are allowed to share circuits with one another. Recognized isolation flags are:
#
# IsolateClientAddr
# Don’t share circuits with streams from a different client address. (On by default and strongly recommended; you can disable it with NoIsolateClientAddr.)
#
# IsolateSOCKSAuth
# Don’t share circuits with streams for which different SOCKS authentication was provided. (On by default; you can disable it with NoIsolateSOCKSAuth.)
#
# IsolateClientProtocol
# Don’t share circuits with streams using a different protocol. (SOCKS 4, SOCKS 5, TransPort connections, NATDPort connections, and DNSPort requests are all considered to be different protocols.)
#
# IsolateDestPort
# Don’t share circuits with streams targeting a different destination port.
#
# IsolateDestAddr
# Don’t share circuits with streams targeting a different destination address.
#
# KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth
# If IsolateSOCKSAuth is enabled, keep alive circuits that have streams with SOCKS authentication set indefinitely.
#
# SessionGroup=INT
# If no other isolation rules would prevent it, allow streams on this port to share circuits with streams from every other port with the same session group. (By default, streams received on different SOCKSPorts, TransPorts, etc are always isolated from one another. This option overrides that behavior.)
#
# Other recognized flags for a SOCKSPort are:
#
# NoIPv4Traffic
# Tell exits to not connect to IPv4 addresses in response to SOCKS requests on this connection.
#
# IPv6Traffic
# Tell exits to allow IPv6 addresses in response to SOCKS requests on this connection, so long as SOCKS5 is in use. (SOCKS4 can’t handle IPv6.)
#
# PreferIPv6
# Tells exits that, if a host has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, we would prefer to connect to it via IPv6. (IPv4 is the default.)
# CacheIPv4DNS
# Tells the client to remember IPv4 DNS answers we receive from exit nodes via this connection. (On by default.)
#
# CacheIPv6DNS
# Tells the client to remember IPv6 DNS answers we receive from exit nodes via this connection.
#
# CacheDNS
# Tells the client to remember all DNS answers we receive from exit nodes via this connection.
#
# UseIPv4Cache
# Tells the client to use any cached IPv4 DNS answers we have when making requests via this connection. (NOTE: This option, along UseIPv6Cache and UseDNSCache, can harm your anonymity, and probably won’t help performance as much as you might expect. Use with care!)
#
# UseIPv6Cache
# Tells the client to use any cached IPv6 DNS answers we have when making requests via this connection.
#
# UseDNSCache
# Tells the client to use any cached DNS answers we have when making requests via this connection.
#
# PreferIPv6Automap
# When serving a hostname lookup request on this port that should get automapped (according to AutomapHostsOnResolve), if we could return either an IPv4 or an IPv6 answer, prefer an IPv6 answer. (On by default.)
#
# PreferSOCKSNoAuth
# Ordinarily, when an application offers both "username/password authentication" and "no authentication" to Tor via SOCKS5, Tor selects username/password authentication so that IsolateSOCKSAuth can work. This can confuse some applications, if they offer a username/password combination then get confused when asked for one. You can disable this behavior, so that Tor will select "No authentication" when IsolateSOCKSAuth is disabled, or when this option is set.
