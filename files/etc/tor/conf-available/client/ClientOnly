# If set to 1, Tor will not run as a relay or serve directory requests, even if the ORPort, ExtORPort, or DirPort options are set. (This config option is mostly unnecessary: we added it back when we were considering having Tor clients auto-promote themselves to being relays if they were stable and fast enough. The current behavior is simply that Tor is a client unless ORPort, ExtORPort, or DirPort are configured.) (Default: 0)
